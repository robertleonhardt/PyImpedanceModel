# PyImpedanceModel
PyImpedanceModel is a lightweight python framework for modeling electrical impedance models.

In its current form, it can be used to setup generic equivalent-circuit models (e.g. for generating dummy electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data) 
and to fit models to real-world impedance data.

Simple example scripts for a) seeting up arbitrary models, and b) fit a model to real-world data can be found in the repo.
